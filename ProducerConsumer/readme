This program demonstrates multiple Producers and Consumers using a shared queue. A Shutter thread is also present which 
can complete a shutdown of the whole process in whatever state the system may be in.
The main program tests different scenarios to put the threads into a blocked state and then unblocks them by meeting required conditions.
The program uses C++ 11's <thread> implementation
